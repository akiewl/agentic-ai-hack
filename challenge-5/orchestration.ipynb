    "# üìã Multi-Agent Insurance Claim Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The `orchestration.ipynb` notebook implements a **sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system** for insurance claim processing using **Microsoft Semantic Kernel** and **Azure AI Agent Service**. This notebook demonstrates advanced concurrent agent coordination to analyze insurance claims from multiple specialized perspectives simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Technologies\n",
    "- **Microsoft Semantic Kernel**: Agent orchestration framework\n",
    "- **Azure AI Agent Service**: Cloud-based agent hosting and management\n",
    "- **Concurrent Orchestration**: Parallel execution of multiple AI agents\n",
    "- **Azure Cosmos DB Integration**: Real-time data access through custom plugins\n",
    "- **Azure Identity**: Secure authentication for Azure services\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Specializations\n",
    "The system creates three specialized AI agents that work concurrently:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **üîç Claim Reviewer Agent**\n",
    "   - Validates claim documentation completeness\n",
    "   - Analyzes damage assessments and cost estimates\n",
    "   - Identifies inconsistencies or missing information\n",
    "   - Provides VALID/QUESTIONABLE/INVALID determinations\n",
    "   - Equipped with Cosmos DB plugin for data retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Analyzer Agent**\n",
    "   - Detects fraud patterns and suspicious indicators\n",
    "   - Assesses claim authenticity and credibility\n",
    "   - Analyzes timing, amounts, and circumstances\n",
    "   - Provides LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH risk assessments\n",
    "   - Equipped with Cosmos DB plugin for historical analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **üìã Policy Checker Agent**\n",
    "   - Validates coverage against policy terms\n",
    "   - Interprets limits, deductibles, and exclusions\n",
    "   - Handles multiple policy types (Auto, Commercial, Motorcycle, etc.)\n",
    "   - Provides COVERED/NOT COVERED/PARTIAL COVERAGE determinations\n",
    "   - Uses Azure AI Search for policy document analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîß Key Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### `create_specialized_agents()`\n",
    "- Establishes Azure AI Agent client connections\n",
    "- Configures each agent with specialized instructions and capabilities\n",
    "- Sets up Cosmos DB plugins for data-enabled agents\n",
    "- Configures polling options for optimal performance\n",
    "- Returns a collection of ready-to-use specialized agents\n",
    "\n",
    "### `run_insurance_claim_orchestration()`\n",
    "- **Concurrent Processing**: All three agents analyze claims simultaneously\n",
    "- **Intelligent Task Distribution**: Each agent receives specialized instructions\n",
    "- **Real-time Data Access**: Agents can retrieve claim data using provided claim IDs\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates unified analysis reports combining all agent outputs\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Robust exception management and resource cleanup\n",
    "- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed logging of orchestration stages\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ Orchestration Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent Creation**: Initializes three specialized insurance processing agents\n",
    "2. **Concurrent Orchestration Setup**: Creates parallel execution framework\n",
    "3. **Task Distribution**: Assigns specialized analysis tasks to each agent\n",
    "4. **Parallel Execution**: All agents work simultaneously on their respective analyses\n",
    "5. **Result Aggregation**: Collects and consolidates outputs from all agents\n",
    "6. **Report Generation**: Creates comprehensive analysis report with all findings\n",
    "7. **Resource Cleanup**: Properly terminates runtime and releases resources\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The system generates a comprehensive **Insurance Claim Analysis Report** that includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Individual Agent Assessments**: Detailed analysis from each specialized perspective\n",
    "- **Claim Validity Status**: Complete documentation and accuracy assessment\n",
    "- **Risk Profile Analysis**: Fraud indicators and authenticity evaluation\n",
    "- **Policy Coverage Determination**: Coverage eligibility and terms validation\n",
    "- **Unified Recommendations**: Consolidated next steps based on all agent analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "## üí° Advanced Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concurrent Execution**: True parallelism for faster processing\n",
    "- **Database Integration**: Real-time access to claim and policy data\n",
    "- **Flexible Configuration**: Environment-based model and endpoint configuration\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed progress tracking and status updates\n",
    "- **Timeout Management**: 5-minute timeout for orchestration completion\n",
    "- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of individual agent failures\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Use Case Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook includes a practical example demonstrating the orchestration of claim analysis for \"CL002\", showing how the system processes claim details and retrieves additional data to provide comprehensive multi-agent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation represents a cutting-edge approach to insurance claim processing, leveraging the power of concurrent AI agents to provide thorough, multi-perspective analysis that would traditionally require multiple human experts working in sequence.\n"

      "Analysis:\n",
      "- Claim Details: The claim (ID: CL001) pertains to an incident on July 17, 2025, involving a 2004 Honda Accord parked legally when struck by another vehicle. Damage includes front bumper dislodged, dents on driver's side front quarter panel, damaged wheel/tire, paint transfer, and potential hidden mechanical damage. Incident reported to police (report #25-52814) with witness and repair estimate attached.\n",
      "- Documentation: The claim is well-documented with photos, police report, repair estimate, and witness statement. The incident description is detailed and consistent with the physical damage.\n",
      "- Damage Assessment: The damage described is moderate to severe, affecting both body and potentially mechanical components. The attached images confirm significant front-left damage and wheel issues, consistent with the claim description.\n",
      "- Policy Documents: No direct policy documents (LIAB-AUTO-001) were found in the system to verify coverage terms, exclusions, limits, or deductibles. This is a critical missing piece to confirm if the claim aligns with policy coverage.\n",
      "- Claim Request: The claimant requests full repair coverage minus deductible, but without policy details, we cannot verify if all repair components are covered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any Missing Info / Concerns:\n",
      "- Lack of accessible policy document for LIAB-AUTO-001 means coverage details are unknown.\n",
      "- Absence of the repair cost estimate details; only a general estimate mention but no cost breakdown.\n",
      "- No verification if deductible amount has been applied or acknowledged.\n",
      "- Need confirmation on damage to mechanical components through further inspection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next Steps:\n",
      "1. Retrieve the full insurance policy document for LIAB-AUTO-001 promptly to assess coverage conditions, limits, and exclusions.\n",
      "2. Obtain detailed repair cost estimate with full breakdown from the repair shop to validate reasonableness against industry norms.\n",
      "3. Confirm deductible amount applicable and if it has been accounted for in the claim request.\n",
      "4. Recommend an independent vehicle mechanic inspection to verify extent of mechanical damage.\n",
      "5. Upon receipt and validation of above, reassess claim validity and finalize recommendation on credit approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without the policy details and complete cost analysis, approving credit now would be premature. Further documentation is essential for a definitive decision.\n",
